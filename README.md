# 🧬 DNA Decoder – A Beginner Bioinformatics Tool

Welcome to my first bioinformatics mini-project!  
This Python script is a beginner-friendly DNA analysis tool that can:

- Count nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C)
- Calculate GC content (%)
- Generate the complementary DNA strand
- Calculate Base (%)

This project was built as part of my learning journey in bioinformatics and programming. 🚀

## 📂 How to Use It

### Option 1: Run it in Google Colab (No Installation Needed)
Click the link below to open and run the code directly in your browser:

👉 [Run on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11ZoaK5rcPj3-L1w39kKmcpaLwPHDYeOf?usp=sharing) 


### Option 2: Run in Python (Locally)
1. Install Python (if not already)
2. Copy the code from `dna_decoder.py`
3. Open a terminal or Python IDE
4. Paste the code and input a DNA sequence (like `ATGCGTAC`)

## 📘 What I Learned

- How to take user input in Python
- Basic string manipulation (`count`, `replace`)
- How to calculate GC content
- Understanding the biological concept of complementarity

## 💡 Future Features (Coming Soon!)

- Graph of base composition (A/T/G/C %) using `matplotlib`
- FASTA file input support
- Translate DNA to protein (codon table)
- Web-based interface using Streamlit or Gradio
